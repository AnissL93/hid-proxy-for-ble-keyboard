A hid proxy using ESP32C3 and CH9329/CH9328

* Solution
I use ESP32C3 as the BLE controller to connect to the keyboard, control LED and store connected bluetooth device addr. And CH9329/CH9328 is used to simulate keyboard.

* Features
- hid proxy for any bluetooth keyboard (with 1812)
- Remember connected keyboard
- LED signals to illustrate connection mode

* Build and flash
Install esp idf
see some link

set target to esp32c3

  #+begin_src bash
idf.py set-target esp32c3
  #+end_src

Then, build and flash to your hid proxy using serial port dev/ttyUSB0. With monitor, you can start monitor after flashing, use Ctrl-] to stop monitor and release the port.

#+begin_src bash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 flash monitor
#+end_src

* Usage

* Todos
- Support store multiple devices and swith with an extra button
- Support ble mouse with ch9329
